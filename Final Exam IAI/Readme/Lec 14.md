## Declarative Knowledge

- Knowledge about facts and concepts

### Characterstics

- #### Static Nature 

    Declarative knowledge is static in nature as facts and concepts dont change

- #### Explicit

    Can be directly expressed is words or symbols

- #### Structured

    Often organized into databases, schemas or ontologies

### Examples

- #### Factual Knowledge

    Representing facts like Water boils at 100 C or Paris is capital of France

- #### Conceptual Knowledge

    Understanding what a vehicle is, its types such as cars, motorcycles etc..

- #### Procedural Knowledge

    Knowledge of programming language syntax and commands, such as knowing how to write a loop in python

### Representation In AI Systems

- #### Knowledge Bases

    Databases that store facts and rules for AI systems

- #### Ontologies

    Formal representation of knowledge representing relationship between concepts and categories

- #### Semantic Networks

    Graph based representation showing relationships between entities

### Applications

- #### Search Engines

    Utilize declarative knowledge to index and retrieve information based on user queries

- #### Question Answering Systems

    Utilize knwoledge bases to provide factual answers to user questions

- #### Expert Systems

    Use declarative knowledge to simulate human expertise in specific domains, such as medical diagnosis

## Procedural Knowledge

- Refers to knowlege about step by step processes
- Knowledge about how something is done

### Characterstics

- #### Dynamic 

    Procedural knowledge tends to be dynamic in nature as steps can change over time

- #### Implicit

    Implicit as can be learned through practice only

- #### Contextual

    Contextual as can change based on context or situations

### Examples

- #### Skill Based Knowledge

    Knowing how to drive a car or how to bake a cake

- #### Algorithmic Knowledge

    Understanding algorithms such as Binary Search

- #### Problem Solving

    Knowing how to approach and solve a problem, such as troubleshooting a computer issue or conducting a scientific experiment

### Representation In AI Systems

- #### Algorithms 

    Step by step procedures that are used by AI systems to perform tasks 

- #### Scripts and Procedures

    Automated sequence of commands that can be executed by AI systems to achieve specific goals

- #### Simulation Models

    Models that replicate real world scenarios for training and refining of procedural knowledge of AI systems

### Applications

- #### Robotics

    Utilize procedural knowledge to control robots and perform tasks, such as assembling products or exploring new environments

- #### Game AI

    Explores procedural knowledge to enable game characters to navigate and interact with game environment

- #### Automation

    Use procedural knowledge to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry or manual processes

## Differences Between Declarative and Procedural Knowledge

- ### Nature

    Declarative knowledge is static and descriptive while procedural knowledge is dynamic and action based

- ### Representation

    Declarative knowledge is represented as facts, rules and structured data while procedural knowledge is represented through algorithms, procedures and scripts

- #### Acquisition

    Declarative knowledge can be expressed explicitely while procedural knowledge is implicit and only gained through practice    

- #### Application

    Declarative knowledge is applied in expert systems and retrieval systems while procedural knowledge is applied in robotics and game AI

## Role In AI System

### Declarative Knowledge In AI

- #### Knowledge Representation

    Essential for creating structured knowledge bases and ontologies that AI systems can leverage 

- #### Reasoning and Inference

    Used by AI systems to make inferences and solve problems based on stated facts and rules

- #### Information Retrieval

    AI systems use declarative knowledge to search and retrieve relevant info from knowledge bases or knowledge graphs

### Procedural Knowledge In AI

- #### Algorithm Implementation

    Used to implement algorithms that drive AI systems and enable them to perform tasks

- #### Automation

    Help in developing systems that automate repetitive tasks

- #### Simulation and Training

    Help in simulating real world scenarios for training AI
